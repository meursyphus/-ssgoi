## Core Functions

### `createTransitionConfig(config: TransitionConfigInput): TransitionConfig`

The grand architect of your transition realm. Use this to define how your pages should move.

```typescript
import { createTransitionConfig, transitions } from 'ssgoi';

const config = createTransitionConfig({
  '/': { '*': transitions.fade },
  '/blog': { 
    '/blog/:id': transitions.slide,
    '*': transitions.fade
  },
  '*': { '*': transitions.zoom }
});
```

Parameters:
- `config`: An object mapping routes to their respective transitions.

Returns:
- A `TransitionConfig` object to be used with the `PageTransition` component.

## Components

### `PageTransition`

The mystical portal through which your pages travel. Wrap your app's content with this component to enable transitions.

```svelte
<script>
  import { PageTransition } from 'ssgoi';
  import transitionConfig from './transitionConfig';
</script>

<PageTransition {transitionConfig}>
  <slot />
</PageTransition>
```

Props:
- `transitionConfig`: The configuration object created by `createTransitionConfig`.

## Transition Effects

SSGOI comes with a set of pre-defined transition effects, each more magical than the last!

### `transitions.fade`

Makes your page fade in and out like a ghost at a disco.

```typescript
transitions.fade({ duration?: number })
```

### `transitions.slide`

Slides your page in and out like it's on a cosmic treadmill.

```typescript
transitions.slide({ duration?: number, direction?: 'left' | 'right' | 'up' | 'down' })
```

### `transitions.zoom`

Zooms your page in and out like it's being viewed through a cosmic magnifying glass.

```typescript
transitions.zoom({ duration?: number, scale?: number })
```

### `transitions.flip`

Flips your page like a interdimensional pancake.

```typescript
transitions.flip({ duration?: number, direction?: 'x' | 'y' })
```

## Configuration

### `TransitionConfigInput`

The blueprint of your transition universe.

```typescript
type TransitionConfigInput = {
  [fromRoute: string]: {
    [toRoute: string]: TransitionEffect | TransitionFunction
  }
};

type TransitionFunction = (from: RouteInfo, to: RouteInfo) => TransitionEffect;

interface RouteInfo {
  path: string;
  params: Record<string, string>;
  query: Record<string, string>;
}
```

## Utility Functions

### `isMobile(): boolean`

A crystal ball to detect if the user is on a mobile device.

```typescript
import { isMobile } from 'ssgoi';

const config = createTransitionConfig({
  '*': { '*': isMobile() ? transitions.fade : transitions.slide }
});
```

Returns:
- `true` if the user is on a mobile device, `false` otherwise.

### `preloadCode(path: string): Promise<void>`

Summons the spirits of future pages to preload them.

```typescript
import { preloadCode } from 'ssgoi';

// Preload the about page
preloadCode('/about');
```

Parameters:
- `path`: The path of the page to preload.

Returns:
- A Promise that resolves when the preloading is complete.
