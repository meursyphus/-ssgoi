# Implementing Dynamic Transitions with SSGOI: Choose Your Own Adventure!

Welcome to the wild world of dynamic transitions! Here, we'll teach you how to make your page transitions as unpredictable as a cat on a hot tin roof. Ready to add some spice to your SSGOI life? Let's dive in!

## The Basics: Transition Functions

In SSGOI, dynamic transitions are like choose-your-own-adventure books, but for your pages. Instead of specifying a transition directly, you provide a function that decides the transition at runtime. It's like giving your pages a magic 8-ball to decide their fate!

Here's the basic structure:

```javascript
'/some-route': {
  '*': (from, to) => {
    // Your decision-making logic goes here
    return transitions.fade; // Or any other transition
  }
}
```

## The Power of 'from' and 'to'

Your transition function gets two powerful friends: `from` and `to`. These objects are like gossip magazines for your routes, full of juicy details:

- `from`: Where your page is coming from
- `to`: Where your page is going

Both objects have properties like `path`, `params`, and `query`. Use them wisely!

## Example 1: The Mood Swing Transition

Let's create a transition that changes based on the time of day:

```javascript
const getMoodTransition = () => {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  if (hour < 6) return transitions.fade; // Sleepy fade for night owls
  if (hour < 12) return transitions.slide; // Energetic slide for morning people
  if (hour < 18) return transitions.zoom; // Power zoom for afternoon productivity
  return transitions.flip; // Evening flip for winding down
};

const transitionConfig = createTransitionConfig({
  '*': {
    '*': (from, to) => getMoodTransition()
  }
});
```

Now your app transitions like it's had its morning coffee... or evening wine!

## Example 2: The Goldfish Memory Transition

Want your app to remember where it came from, but only for a short while? Try this:

```javascript
let lastVisitedPage = null;

const transitionConfig = createTransitionConfig({
  '*': {
    '*': (from, to) => {
      const transition = from.path === lastVisitedPage ? transitions.fade : transitions.slide;
      lastVisitedPage = to.path;
      return transition;
    }
  }
});
```

Your app now has the memory of a goldfish, but with style!

## Example 3: The Responsive Transition

Let's make our transitions responsive. Because even transitions should look good on mobile:

```javascript
const getResponsiveTransition = () => {
  return window.innerWidth < 768 ? transitions.fade : transitions.slide;
};

const transitionConfig = createTransitionConfig({
  '*': {
    '*': (from, to) => getResponsiveTransition()
  }
});
```

Now your transitions are as adaptable as a chameleon in a crayon factory!

## Example 4: The Easter Egg Transition

Hide a little surprise for your users:

```javascript
const transitionConfig = createTransitionConfig({
  '*': {
    '*': (from, to) => {
      if (to.path === '/secret' && from.query.konami === 'true') {
        return transitions.flip({ duration: 1000, direction: 'y' });
      }
      return transitions.fade;
    }
  }
});
```

If a user navigates to '/secret?konami=true', they get a special flip transition. It's like finding a golden ticket in your Wonka bar!

## The Sky's the Limit!

With dynamic transitions, you're limited only by your imagination (and maybe your JavaScript skills). You could create transitions based on:

- User preferences
- Time spent on the previous page
- Number of visits to your site
- Current weather in the user's location
- Phase of the moon

The possibilities are as endless as a MÃ¶bius strip!

## A Word of Caution

Remember, with great power comes... well, you know the rest. Don't go too crazy with your dynamic transitions. The goal is to enhance user experience, not to make your users feel like they're in a disco-themed haunted house.

Now go forth and make those transitions dance to the rhythm of your app's heartbeat! ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ
