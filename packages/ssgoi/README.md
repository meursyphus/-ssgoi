# Svelte Page Transition

Svelte Page Transition is a library designed to easily apply animation effects during page transitions in Svelte. It was created to provide a transition library that is compatible with all browsers, as the view transition provided by Chrome is only applicable to Chrome.

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to make it easy to apply animation effects when moving pages in Svelte. It uses Svelte's in, out, and transition.

## Installation

(Installation instructions will go here)

## Usage

To use Svelte Page Transition, wrap the slot in `PageTransitionRoot` in your `layout.svelte`. Then, declare `PageTransition` for each page. You can assign animation types to `PageTransition` through `transitions`. The animation type can be dynamically set depending on where the page came from and where it is going.
